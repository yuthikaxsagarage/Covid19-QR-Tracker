# Covid19_Tracker_ios_app
Swift application was developed to  check QR codes from the covid19 quarantine houses and manage the PHI rounds,
and also the doctor visits. When the quarantine is over the status of the record is updated. 
The records can be updated at any given time by scanning the QR codes, however QR code gets cross checked with the phone location.
